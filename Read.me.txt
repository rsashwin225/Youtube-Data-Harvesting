Project: YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

Overview:
This project aims to collect data from YouTube channels and playlists, process it, and store it in a data warehouse for further analysis. By harvesting data from YouTube, valuable insights can be gained regarding popular channels, trending topics, and audience preferences.

Objectives:
Data Collection: Retrieve data from YouTube API for channels and playlists.
Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the collected data for analysis.
Data Warehousing: Store the processed data in a structured format suitable for analysis.
Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights from the data.
Visualization: Visualize the findings using charts, graphs, and other visualization techniques.
Reporting: Create reports summarizing the key findings and insights.
Tools and Technologies:
YouTube API: For data retrieval from YouTube.
Python: For scripting, data processing, and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
SQL Database: For data storage and warehousing.
Visualization Libraries: Such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization.
Git: For version control and collaboration (optional).
Workflow:
Data Retrieval: Use the YouTube API to fetch data for channels and playlists based on specified criteria.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the raw data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.
Data Storage: Design and create a SQL database schema to store the processed data.
Data Loading: Load the cleaned data into the SQL database tables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and insights.
Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the findings effectively.
Reporting: Summarize the key findings in a report along with visualizations and insights.
Usage:
Setting Up: Install required dependencies (Python libraries, SQL database) and set up API access to YouTube.
Data Retrieval: Run scripts to fetch data from YouTube channels and playlists.
Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the retrieved data using Python scripts.
Data Warehousing: Design and create SQL tables to store the processed data.
Data Loading: Load the cleaned data into the SQL database tables.
Analysis and Visualization: Analyze the data using Python scripts and visualize the findings.
Reporting: Prepare reports summarizing the insights and findings from the analysis.
Future Enhancements:
Implement automated data retrieval and processing pipelines.
Incorporate machine learning algorithms for advanced analysis and prediction.
Explore additional data sources for enriching the analysis.
Deploy the project as a web application or dashboard for wider access.
